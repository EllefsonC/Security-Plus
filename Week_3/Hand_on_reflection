This week our labs have been around the key idea of keeping system security up to date and being aware of current exploits that may be affecting your systems. Learning about the windows defender integrated security measures, specifically the Windows Controlled Folder Access, helps signficantly towards system security against ransomware. This goes towards Defenses and Embedded Device Security. 
Learning about CVE on Microsofts Security Response Center was both eye opening and informative to the common attack types that threat actors take. It also tells how often Window's OS is being probbed for weaknesses and the work it takes to keep these systems secure. This played towards both the concepts of Vulnerabilites and Attacks.
In project 6-1, we visited created a QR code to go to cengage.com. Through this we learned about how easy it is to redirect someone to a more maliciuous webesite since the URL is hidden. The reflects on the ideas of Mobile and Attacks since it is an easy threat vector that can can effect people mobile devices.
Finally in project 5-6 we reviewed the ransomware website nomoreransomware.org. It is a helpful organization that has in-depth guides that can help people who have become affected by ransomware, with decryption software available if it is one of the types they have dealt with before. There is a Cyber Sheriff that is a page where you upload the information about the ransomware you are dealing with and they will find you a solution if it is one they have history with, and potentially help with new ones. This relates with attacks and defenses since it is in-depth with how ransomware attacks take place in it's Q&A and helps with Defenses with its library of decryption software and guides
